  <!-- <font color="red"><b>I am on the academic job market this year.</b> </font> <br> -->
  <br>
  I am a tenure-track assistant professor at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University，浙江大学</a>. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">The University of Edinburgh </a> (Centre for Global Health Sciences)，爱丁堡大学博士后研究员. I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="http://www.sutd.edu.sg/">The University of Edinburgh</a> (SUTD)，爱丁堡大学. I was a visiting student at <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a> . <br> 

  <br>
  My research interests are mainly focused on artificial intelligence 
(AI) in healthcare/public health and natural language processing. I 
served as an  <font color="red">area chair of EMNLP 2021</font> , <font color="red">SPC of AMIA 2020 annual symposium</font>,
  the program committee of top-tier conferences: 
ACL/AAAI/IJCAI/EMNLP/NAACL/AMIA/ICML/ICLR. I was selected as ACL 2018 
outstanding reviewer, COLING 2018 outstanding reviewer. I won the <font color="red">COLING Best Paper Award</font> at 2018, <font color="red">ACL Best demo Paper Award Nomination</font> at 2018, and <font color="red">ISTD Best Dissertation Award</font>. I am the developer of several popular NLP tools: <a href="https://github.com/jiesutd/NCRFpp"><b>NCRF++</b> </a> and <a href="https://github.com/jiesutd/YEDDA"><b>YEDDA</b></a>, which attracted more than 4000 stars at GitHub. <br>

  
  <br>
  I love badminton and swimming (Silver medal in Men's 100 metres freestyle at Chongqing University).
